# SynaNN - Synaptic Neural Network

A Synaptic Neural Network (SynaNN) consists of synapses and neurons. Inspired by the research of biological synapses, we abstracted a synapse as a nonlinear function of two excitatory and inhibitory probabilities

SynaMPL for Keras illustrates the application of Synaptic Neural Network to Multiple Layer Perceptrons. Synaptic Multiple Layer Perceptrons is the fully-connected Multiple Layer Perceptron (Minsky et al. (2017)) with two hidden layers connected by a synapse tensor along with an input layer and an output layer. Input and output layers act as downsize and classifiers while hidden layer of the synapse tensor plays the role of distribution transformation. The activation functions are required to connected
